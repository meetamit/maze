#Fairy Maze
This work in progress is a simple maze game. The game objective is to get through the maze from start to finish without backtracking. Players get penalized when they backtrack (penalty not yet implemented, but backtracking "awareness" and visualization is).

To play, navigate (with a touch device only!) to http://meetamit.github.io/maze. Tap the screen to move the dot. To win, get to the green dot and prepare to be delighted (at least if you're a 4 year old girl).

#Ideas
- Some sections of the maze could be on turntables that rotate the walls on it. Turntables can only be operated when standing beside them.
